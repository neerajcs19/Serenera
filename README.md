Monitor Chrome Browsing to detect levels of Depression

## Overview

Google receives 63000 searches per second on any given day. An average person conducts 3-4 searches every day. According to a report 322 million people worldwide live with depression. Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Almost 75% of people with mental disorders remain untreated in developing countries with almost 1 million people taking their lives each year.

Detecting earlier depression can be a huge step to address the mental illness and offer support to the people suffering from this terrible mental illness.

This depression can be easily detected in the first stages using the pattern seen in search queries. Text analysis, owner analysis (behavior patterns like searches-per-day), temporal analysis (time of day when people search), and visual analysis of pictures searched could be the parameters of detecting depression.

Women experience depression at roughly twice the rate of men. Fewer than half of the women who experience clinical depression will ever seek care. Interactive quizzes and chatbots could help them overcome this depression by providing information about a good doctor.

Thus, our application Serenera aims to reduce depression and instil mental peace and serenity.
