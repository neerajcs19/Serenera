Monitor Chrome Browsing to detect levels of Depression 

---

## Overview

Google receives 63000 searches per second on any given day. An average person conducts 3-4 searches every day. According to a report 322 million people worldwide live with depression. Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Almost 75% of people with mental disorders remain untreated in developing countries with almost 1 million people taking their lives each year.

Detecting earlier depression can be a huge step to address the mental illness and offer support to the people suffering from this terrible mental illness.

This depression can be easily detected in the first stages using the pattern seen in search queries. Text analysis, owner analysis (behavior patterns like searches-per-day), temporal analysis (time of day when people search), and visual analysis of pictures searched could be the parameters of detecting depression.

Women experience depression at roughly twice the rate of men. Fewer than half of the women who experience clinical depression will ever seek care. Interactive quizzes and chatbots could help them overcome this depression by providing information about a good doctor.

Thus, our application Serenera aims to reduce depression and instil mental peace and serenity.

## Approach:

### **UI**
- The user interface is a chrome extension, i.e., a web-based UI.
- When the extension is enabled, it gives the depression levels of the person browsing on a scale of 1 to 10. A rating of 1 would indicate high levels of depression, while a rating of 10 will indicate low levels of depression.
- This add-on additionally suggests measures and therapies to deal with depression. For example, depression relieving music, an appointment with a doctor or psychiatrist, etc.
- There is also therapy chatbot or survey which helps to relieve depression and anxiety of the person. For now, it is just a simple chatbot created from `Landbot.io`. In the upcoming versions, we are planning to make it even more intelligent so as to tend to user needs as efficiently as possible.
